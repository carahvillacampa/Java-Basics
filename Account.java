package hw2;

/*
 * 1. private int data field named id for the account
 * 2. private double named balance for the account
 * 3. private double data field named annualInterestRate that stores the current interest rate
 * with a default of 0
 * 4. a private Date data field named date created that stores the date when the account
 * was created
 * 5. a no arg constructor that creates a default account
 * 6. A constructor that creates an account with the specified Id and initial balance
 * 7. accessor and mutator methods for id, balance, annualInterestRate
 * 8. accessor method for dateCreated
 * 9. getMonthlyInterestRate() that returns the monthly interest rate
 * 10. a method named withdraw that withdraws a specified amount from the account
 * 11. a method named deposit that deposists a specified amount to the account
 * 
 * Tester:
 * 1. write a test program that creates an Account object with an accountID of 1122
 * 2. balance of 20,000 and an annual interest rate of 4.5% 
 * 3. Use the withdraw method to withdraw 2,500
 * 4. use the deposit method to deposit 3000 and print the balance, monthly interest and the
 * date when the account was created
 * 
 * Hints:
 * 1. getMonthlyInterest= return monthly interest
 * 2. Monthly interest is balance*monthlyInterestRate.monthlyInterestRate 
 * is annualInterestRate/12
 * 3. note that annualInterestRate is a percentage so multiply by 100
